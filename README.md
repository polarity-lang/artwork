![Polarity logo](logo_white_128.png)

The Polarity logo is inspired by an [arctic hare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_hare) which has a white winter coat and a dark summer coat. The fur pattern resembles the yin and yang symbol, playing on the duality between data and codata.

The logo was designed by Hendrik Süberkrüb.
